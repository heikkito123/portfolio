# Kernighan & Ritchie - C programming Language 2nd edition

This folder consists of a selected few programs from the K&R C programming, 2nd edition, mostly from the later chapters of the book.

# The short(ish) version

I initially got into C via studying Jonathan Bartletts "Learn To Program with Assembly", a book about x86-64 architecture assembly language. Whereas it was interesting
and packed with information - not only about programming but the actual hardware if you run your codes with debugger- it quite quickly started to rely on external C libraries
and function calls. Since assembly is anyway highly platform dependent, i figured it would probably be best to skim the rest of the book and pick up K&R instead. On a side note, 
at times this lead to an interesting finding: even though C is essentially the next step after assembly, it's still high enough level language that it abstracts away 
certain levels of hardware interfacing. After assembly, it really took me a couple days to get my head around bit banging and other very low level concepts. The other 
interesting thing to notice is the historical context of the book. One can truly see that K&R we're at a level much closer to the hardware, and with my prior knowledge about 
high level languages like Python, it gave very slim prerequisites for studying this book. And with the latter, you can truly see that there was no vibe code pass for 
programming, you really needed to know what you were doing with the hardware you had. What i didn't expect and realize until the later chapters, is that between the lines 
K&R seems to try and make you understand the what's and why's behind the how's. Though it might not be relevant for todays programs at all levels (well probably most 
levels it is), K&R makes you question the efficiency of your algorithm an the CPU level. All in all, i've loved the challenge up to the last chapter, it's been a handful 
at almost every turn of the page, but it really has paid off in learning other topics of programming and computing in general.
