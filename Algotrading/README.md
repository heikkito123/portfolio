# A study into algorithmic trading and technical analysis

This project was done out of curiosity and a long interest in investing and trading, mostly for studying technical analysis and algorithmic trading. The project 
mostly consists of basics, the use of selected libraries and visualization of data. The underlying concepts are mostly from the book "Technical Analysis of 
the Financial Markets", by John J. Murphy, although i've read many more, such as "Systematic Trading" by Robert Carver and "Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading" by
Stefan Jansen. Jansen's book is very interesting, but the concepts themselves are quite complicated, and many - if not most APIs are behind paywalls or out of
reach for retail traders. The book does not confine itself to the basic concepts, but studies way beyond from real-time satellite imaging of natural states,
scraping of consumer behavior during different market conditions to connecting dots between large data and human / institutional behavior and the markets.
The question remains, did i lose any money? No. Did i make any money? Also no. Cues can be found e.g. in the book "The Man Who Solved The Market"
by Gregory Zuckerman, a biography of Jim Simons. Algorithmic trading - or markets themselves as a whole - is complicated and chaotic universe of an
ever changing mischievous being. Success in trading is part art, part science, part alchemy and occult and the lizard people, and it is not solved by simple 
rules. Quants codebase consists of probably billions of lines of code, twisting and turning into something that for a retailer would seems like a huge
black box. None the less, studying the markets, leveraging data and trying to fish out meaningful signals is absolutely and infinitely interesting.
