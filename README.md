# Portfolio – Heikki Tolonen

Hi! I'm Heikki, an aspiring programmer transitioning from a successful career as a construction entrepreneur into the world of tech.  

For allmost 10 years I ran a construction company (turnover €2.7M–€4M, project sizes up to €900K, teams of 30–40 people). Along the way, I started writing small Python utility scripts to automate invoice handling and timetables — and quickly discovered the power of programming to solve real-world problems. Since then, I’ve been fully committed to building a career in tech.
